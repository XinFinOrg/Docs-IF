- Buyer pays invoice amount to financier. A financier pays final payment(by deducting fees) to supplier.

Fee calculation is done on the basis of Interest Rate (as per factoring criteria) and payout date. If Buyer pays invoice amount earlier to financier, fees will be less and vice versa. The fees calculation is done on the smart contract.

- Financier and Supplier can rate each other.
